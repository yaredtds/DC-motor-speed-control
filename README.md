# DC-Motor-Speed-Control, a Proteus simulation
Example of usage of LIBPIDv2 for DC Motor speed control, Proteus simulation

The simulation consists the speed measurement method using encoder and pid controller library. The proteus 8.11 is used for this demonstration and the Arduino-avr-gcc should be installed  on it.
